# ESE5190 Final Project

Use this repository for your Final project.

How to compile and run the code:

To compile the codes 
1. First, you need to add files 'ASCII_LUT.h', 'LCD_GFX(1).c', 'LCD_GFX.h', 'ST7735.c', 'ST7735.h' into your 'mains code' in Microchip studio as a library for writing or drawing tests or graphs on Lcd display.
2. Second, you can connect your arduino unp R3 board with your lap top and run the main codes to control the robotic arm part to move.
3. Third, you need to run the 'GSM Module' code on Arduino IDE and connect Arduino MKR GSM 1400 Board with you lap top and run it to dial any phone number.
